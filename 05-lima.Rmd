# Lima, et al {#lima}

In 2003, we proposed a KAS [@Lima2013c] based in a color prioritization of candidates in waiting list for kidney transplantation. The aim of that proposal was to define a simple and transparent set of rules that could be used as a baseline in comparison to others KAS.Also, with this color classification it would be easier to explained to patients, in a more intuitive manner, how far they are from being transplanted. 

This system of colors also takes into account the criteria of utility and justice for kidney distribution. By setting only 4 colour groups (figure \@ref(fig:colors)) on the basis of justice (time on dialysis and probability of transplantation) and, within each of these groups, candidates are ordered based by efficiency (HLA compatibilities); the proposed criteria meant to be balanced [@Lima2013c].

Whenever the risk of a poor transplant outcome exists and is predictable, this fact must be explained to the patient.

```{r colors, fig.cap="Kidney allocation color system", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/colors.jpg', dpi = 150)
```

With this model patients are classified according to their clinical urgency (red color), and regarding their time on dialysis and cPRA value. With a orange color are marked those patients with a cPRA > 85% or with a time on dialysis higher than the waiting list 3rd quartile. As yellow are classified the patients with a cPRA > 50% or with a time on dialysis higher than the waiting list median. And, as green are classified all the rest. Also, patients are allocated to donors within the same age group (old to old program) [@Lima2017].

## User's options {#limaoptions}

```{r limaoptions, fig.cap="Values for Lima's algorithm", fig.align='left'}

```

## Model simulation

On the main panel of the *Portugal* module, we can run the simulation for **One donor** or for **Multiple donors**. 

When selected the option for **One donor** (figure \@ref(fig:ptonedonor)), the user can input donor's age, his blood group and his HLA typing.
