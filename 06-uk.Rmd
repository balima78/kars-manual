# UK transplant {#uk}

United Kingdom (UK) deceased donor kidney allocation for transplantation is firstly based on de definition of two ranked Tiers of candidates eligible for the donor.

The UK transplant module on KARS app simulates the allocation of kidneys to a candidates' waiting list to kidney-only transplantes and do not take in consideration geographical criteria. Thealgorithm aplied in KARS app is a simplification of the [UK National Health Sistem policy](https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/16915/kidney-allocation-policy-pol186.pdf). 

For each available donor, eligible candidates are those with a negative virtual crossmatch and ABO compatible with the donor. These candidates are them grouped in to TIERS:

```{r UKtiersflow, fig.cap="Ranked Tiers", fig.align='left'}
library(DiagrammeR)

DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph ETgraph {

graph [layout = dot]

# node definitions with substituted label text
node [shape = rectangle, width = 4, fillcolor = Biege]
a [label = '@@1']
b [label = '@@2']

a -> b

}

[1]: 'TIER A: patients with match score = 10 OR cPRA = 100% OR time on dialysis > 7 years'
[2]: 'TIER B: all other eligible patients'

")
```

Within **TIER A** transplant candidates are ordered by [matchability](#ms) and [time on dialysis](#tod). Transplant candidates within **TIER B** are prioritized according to a points-based system computed with 7 elements.

Donor - recipient blood group compatibility is defined as ABO identical, with exceptions:

- B candidates can opt to O donors; 
- AB candidates can opt to A donors;
- within **TIER A**, candidates A and AB can opt to O donors.

```

## Points-based system {#ukpoints}

Transplant candidates are ordered by assigned points for each available donor. Those points are computed as the sum of 7 elements: 

1. [Matchability](#ms)
2. [Time on dialysis](#tod)
3. [Donor-recipient risk index combinations](#dric)
4. [HLA match and age combined](#HLAage)
5. [Donor-recipient age difference](#agediff)
6. [Total HLA mismatch](#HLAtotal)
7. [Blood group match](#blood)

### Matchability {#ms}

Points for matchability are calculated from the formula: $10 \cdot (1 + (MatchScore / 4.5)^{4.7})$, where $MatchScore$ (MS) take values $1$ trough $10$ corresponding to candidates' percentil on waiting list when computed the number of donors ABO identical and HLA compatible for each candidate. 

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
In the [example data](#example) provided on KARS app, $MS$ were assigned randomly with a probability of 0.03 for $MS = 10$.
```

### Time on dialysis {#tod}

For each day on dialysis, 1 point is given to transplant candidates, meaning that for each month, 30 points are assigned to candidates. As described for [example data](#example), time on dialysis must be in months.

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
Time on dialysis (column *dialysis*) must be in months!

In order to maintain congruence between the criteria used in the different app allocation systems, uploaded time on dialysis must be in months.  
```

### Donor-recipient risk index combinations {#dric}

As described in the [example data](#example) candidates' dataset have a column for recipient risk index (**RRI**) and donors' dataset have a column for donor risk index (**DRI**). Also, [user's data](#users) must have these columns. Both RRI and DRI can have 4 categories, R1 to R4 and D1 to D4, respectively.

Computation of recipients and donors' categories are described on [UK National Health Sistem policy](https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/16915/kidney-allocation-policy-pol186.pdf). 

Points are defined as:

```{r dric, tidy=F}
dt<-data.frame(R1=c(1000,700,350,0),
                   R2=c(700,1000,500,350),
                   R3=c(350,500,1000,700),
                   R4=c(0,350,700,1000))
rownames(dt)<-c("D1","D2","D3","D4")

dt %>% knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = 'Donor-Recipient risk index combinations.')
    
```

### HLA match and age combined {#HLAage}

For HLA match and age combined, first we must define HLA mismatch levels for HLA-A, -B and -DR for each donor-recipient pair:

```{r hlamm, tidy=T}

hlamm<-read_csv2("files/HLAmm.csv")

knitr::kable(
  hlamm, caption = 'HLA mismatch levels for HLA-A, -B and -DR',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

Afterwards, candidates' points are defined according to each level:

- Level 1 =   $1200 \cdot \cos(age/18) + 2300$
- Level 2 =   $750 \cdot \cos(age/18) + 1500$
- Level 3+4 = $400 \cdot \sin(age/50$

### Donor-recipient age difference {#agediff}

Points for age difference between the donor and the transplant candidates are given for:

$\frac{1}{2} \cdot($donor-candidate age difference$)^2$

### Total HLA mismatch {#HLAtotal}

Points for total mismatch between donor and candidates are calculated based on the number of mismatchs at HLA-A, -B and -DR: 

- total HLA mismatch = 0: 0 points;
- total HLA mismatch = 1: -100 points;
- total HLA mismatch = 2-3: -150 points;
- total HLA mismatch = 4-6: -250 points.

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
Originally, UK policy total mismatch score is calculated based on the number of mismatchs at HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DR and -DQ.

In KARS app, since only data on HLA-A, -B and -DR are used, total mismatch score is calculated only on these 3 loci.   
```


### Blood group match {#blood}

Within **TIER B** candidates and for O blood group donors, a thousand points are substracted to those candidates (-1000 points).

## Users' options

UK transplant algorithm depends on the points assigned for the [7 elements](#ukpoints) described earlier and for 5 of these elements, points can be redefined by KARS app's users on the sidebar panel on 'UK transplant' module. 

Users can define the points to each day on dialysis:

```{r uktod, fig.cap="Points per day on dialysis", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/uktod.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

For the criteria [HLA match and age combined](#HLAage), users can input coefficient values on the equation for the 3 HLA levels between donor and candidates:

```{r ukhlaage, fig.cap="Points for HLA match and age combined", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ukhlaage.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

Points for candidates' [matchability](#ms) can be adjusted by the parameters 'm', 'n' and 'o' on the equation, the plot shows how theses parameters influence attributed points:

```{r ukmatch, fig.cap="Points for matchability", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ukmatch.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

Penalizations on [total HLA mismatch](#HLAtotal) can also be defined by the users: 

```{r uktotalhla, fig.cap="Total HLA mismatch penalization", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/uktotalhla.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

Finally, users can define for how much blood group B candidates should be penalize when the available donor is group O:

```{r ukblood, fig.cap="Blood group penalization", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ukblood.jpg', dpi = NA)
```


```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```

## Model simulation

Uk transplant model simulation allows '**One donor**' selection or simulation for '**Multiple donors**'. In the first case, users can define donor's characteristics and donor risk index is computed:  

```{r ukonedonor, fig.cap="Inputs for donor's characteristics and Donor Risk Index computation", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ukonedonor.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

Users can select: donor's age, height, gender, eGFR, days in hospital, blood group, HLA typing and if the donor have an history of hypertension or ife the dnoors is CMV +ve.

As result of the module a table with top 10 selected candidates for this specific donor will be displayed.

When option '**Multiple donors**' is selected, users just have to run it and wait for the results. Again, here as previously described for the previous algorithms, a downloadable dataset with donor-recipientes pairs characteristics and a table with the resumed characteristics will be displayed.  

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```
