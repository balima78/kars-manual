# Upload data {#data}

KARS app uses as inputs three files with demographic and immunological information of kidney transplant candidates and deceased donors.

This application can be used with the provided example data, or by uploading users' data. The available example data is synthetic data for a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates and for 70 potential deceased donors.

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```

## Example data {#example}

The first example dataset simulates a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates, with the columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2 ), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), candidate's age in years (age), number of months on dialysis (dialysis) and calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies (cPRA).

```{r candidates, tidy=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '-')
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

candvar<-read_csv2("files/candvar.csv")

knitr::kable(
  candvar, caption = 'Variables for candidates dataset',
  booktabs = FALSE
) %>%  footnote(general = "* UK only")
```

The second dataset compiles the HLA antibodies (abs) for each transplant candidate in the previous dataset and it only have two columns: Identifier (ID) and HLA-abs (abs) (table \@ref(tab:candidates)). This candidate ID must match the ID of the transplant candidates’ waiting list to allow the determination of virtual crossmatch between each candidate and the potential deceased donor, as described in section \@ref(pt).

```{r abs, tidy=T}

absvar<-read_csv2("files/absvar.csv")

knitr::kable(
  absvar, caption = 'Variables for HLA-antibodies dataset',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

The last dataset compiles data from 70 potential deceased donors with columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), donor's age in years (age):

```{r donors, tidy=T}

donorvar<-read_csv2("files/donorvar.csv")

knitr::kable(
  donorvar, caption = 'Variables for HLA-antibodies dataset',
  booktabs = TRUE
) %>%  footnote(general = "* UK only")
```

This is the minimum information required for each kidney transplant candidate and potential donor, in the different kidney allocation systems (KAS) used in this app.

In the case of UK-transplant KAS, transplant candidates' dataset should also contain the columns: Tier, Match Score (MS) and Recipient Risk Index (RRI). The dataset of potential donors should also have a column with Donor Risk Index (DRI) as described in section \@ref(dric).

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```

## User's data {#users}

This application allow any user to upload their own data. For this purpose users just have to select option '*Upload your files*' and browse the files:

```{r upload, fig.cap="'Upload your files' option", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/upload.jpg', dpi = 100)
```

The data uploaded by the user must have the same format as examples described in section \@ref(example). If users' data do not have the same format, KARS app will return the message:

```{block, type='message', echo = T}
Candidates column names are not identical to example data!
```

Also, users must be aware if he/she want to use UK transplant algorithm. In this case option '*UK*' must be selected and  files must have extra columns described in table \@ref(tab:candidates) and table \@ref(tab:donors).

In KARS app, users can upload a .txt or .csv file specifying 'File's delimiter' from available options: 

```{r delimiter, fig.cap="'Files delimiter' options", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/delimiter.jpg', dpi = 100)
```

Those files must have the same exact header (case sensitive) as the ones from [example data](#example).

For *bg* field (both for candidates and donors) the valid options are: A, AB, B and O. 

The HLA typing for *HLA-A, -B* and *–DRB1* loci must have a consistent resolution level for HLA-antibodies identified in the second dataset, as well, with HLA typing of potential deceased donors. For instance, if HLA typing for candidates is in serological resolution so donor's typing and identified HLA antibodies must be in serological resolution too. In like manner, for a genotyping resolution all HLA must be consistent. When alleles have a 0 on the left (meaning A01 or DR04) it can be omitted only if this is always the case, as we do in our example data. By the same token, on our example data, if donors have the values **1** and **4** for columns *DR1* and *DR2*, so the correspondent HLA antibodies in the second dataset (table \@ref(tab:donors)) will be **DR1** and **DR4**, respectively.

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
In order to avoid problems with blanks on HLA typing, candidates and / or donors must be considered homozigous and the alleles must be repeated (as an example: instead of *B15,-* consider *B15,15*) 
```

For candidates' dataset we recommend a sample size no longer than 2000 and for donors' dataset a ratio of 1 / 7 candidates. Meaning, for 700 candidates use at most 100 donors. 

This ratio is suggested as guarantee that selected candidates for each KAS are comparable and we can spot differences due to KAS rules. As each donor is allocated to two candidates, with a number of donors close to half the number of candidates, we would have almost all candidates selected for all KAS simulations. 

> Also, synthetic data for KARS app can be generated from the R package [{simK}](https://txopen.github.io/simK/index.html). This package was developed mainly for allowing data generation to use on KARS simulations.
