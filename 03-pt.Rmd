# Portugal {#pt}

Portuguese rules on allocation of kidneys from deceased donors (PT model) were published on ordinance 6357/2007 and are based on a scoring system (table \@ref(tab:ord6357)) that takes in consideration: HLA mismatches between donor and transplant candidate; level of immunization of the candidate; time on dialysis; and age difference between donor and transplant candidate.

```{r ord6357, tidy=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

ord6357<-read_csv2("files/ord6357.csv")

knitr::kable(
  ord6357, caption = 'Scoring from Ordinance n.ยบ 6357/2007 (PT model)',
  booktabs = FALSE
) %>%  footnote(general = "* Mismatches for HLA-A locus are used to break punctual ties")
```

The aforementioned ordinance also impose for each available deceased donor only candidates with the same donor's blood group (**ABO identical**) and with a **negative virtual crossmatch** (i.e. candidates cannot have known HLA antibodies against donor's HLA) can opt to a kidney from that donor.

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
For each available donor, eligible candidates are those **ABO identical** and with a **negative virtual crossmatch**!
```


According to the ordinance 11420/2008, Hipersensitized candidates (cPRA > 85%) are prioritized and after hat ordered by their corresponding score.

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```

## User's options {#ptoptions}

From KARS app (module *Portugal*) we can simulate the rules from the PT model, setting the scores as we pleased. On sidebar panel, default punctuation (figure \@ref(fig:ptpoints)) is presented but users can mess with it and apply new set of scores to reorder candidates in waiting listfor a given donor.

```{r ptpoints, fig.cap="Punctuation for PT model", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ptpoints.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

It is also available, on first check, from sidebar panel, the possibility to select candidates not necessarily ABO identical with the donor but merely ABO compatible (when the option is not checked). 

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```

## Model simulation {#ptsimulation}

On the main panel of *Portugal* module, we can run the simulation for **One donor** or for **Multiple donors**. 

When selected option **One donor** (figure \@ref(fig:ptonedonor)), the user can input donor's age, his blood group and his HLA typing.

```{r ptonedonor, fig.cap="Donor's characteristics", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ptonedonor.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

According to the donor's characteristics *top 10 selected candidates for this specific donor* are tabled. This candidates can be selected from the example data, provided with the app, or from a dataset uploaded by the user. In this last scenario, user must upload also a dataset with candidates' HLA antibodies otherwise a message is displayed:

```{block, type='message', echo = T}
Please select candidates' HLA antibodies data set!
```

When selected option **Multiple donors** (figure \@ref(fig:ptmultdonor)) the user just have to click on *'Select your options an run it!'* and wait for the results.

```{r ptmultdonor, fig.cap="Donor's characteristics", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ptmultdonor.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

```{block, type='warning', echo = T}
Depending on the size of uploaded data, the run can take several seconds.

Be patient! 
```

After the run, a dataset (dowloadable) with selected candidates and a table with a summary of candidates' characteristics are displayed.

```{r fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kars.jpg', dpi = 200)
```
