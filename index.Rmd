# Preface {-}

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, message = F, warning = F)
doc.type <- knitr::opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to')

knitr::include_graphics('images/kidneys.jpg', dpi = 100)

The **Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator** (KARS) is an application that allows to simulate different kidney allocation rules in transplantation.

This application is built on shiny and is available on shinyapps.io: <https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/>

Before implementing new rules, it is necessary to test them in order to dissipate, as much as possible, doubts questioning implementation’s success. The development of this application had as motivation being an aid to clarify the usefulness and efficiency of new set of rules for kidney allocation.

```{r heads, fig.cap='HEADS | FMUP', fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
library(png)
knitr::include_graphics('images/heads.png', dpi = 200)
```

KARS app is part of my PhD thesis on the PhD program in Health Data Science (HEADS).
