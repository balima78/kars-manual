This application is built on shiny and is available on shinyapps.io: https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/ Before implementing new rules, it is necessary to test them in order to dissipate, as much as possible, doubts questioning implementation’s success. The development of this application had as motivation being an aid to clarify the usefulness and efficiency of new set of rules for kidney allocation. Figure 0.1: HEADS | FMUP KARS app is part of my PhD thesis on the PhD program in Health Data Science (HEADS) 0.1.

["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Kidney transplantation main challenges are: achieving better outcomes for patients and grafts, improving recipients’ quality of life and increasing the number of available organs (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013c). The demand for kidneys for transplantation grows daily due to the successful treatment of many patients with end stage renal disease. Although, the limited number of organs available for transplantation requires that their distribution be made as equitable as possible in order to optimize the use of this scarce resource (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013a). For patients with end stage renal disease, kidney transplantation provides a lower mortality, reduction of cardiovascular problems and a better quality of life compared with those on dialysis, even for those with advanced age or co-morbidities (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). Criteria such as: clinical urgency, waiting time, diagnosis, duration of ischaemia, transplant outcomes, number of organs available for paediatric transplants, transplantation in the elderly, time on dialysis, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility and the presence or absence of HLA antibodies; should be taken into account when discussing access to kidney transplantation (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). This user’s manual describes how to use the Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator (KARS) app available from here: https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/. The manual is divided in 7 chapters, the first one is this Introduction (1), the last one is a simple Conclusion (7) and the remaining 5 correspond to the 5 modules on KARS app, four of them are different Kidney Allocation Systems (KAS). The chapter 2 describe the type of data used in the application and how the user can upload their own data. This data is not stored anywhere on our app and the responsibility for its usage is entirely from the user. Chapter 3 presents the Portuguese algorithm on the allocation of kidneys from deceased donors and how the user can modify some parameters in order to understand how it works. In chapter 4 the KAS from EuroTransplnat is described and it’s merits discussed. Chapter 5 present a KAS published by us in 2013 (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b) and was intented to give a simple (maybe too simple) solution for a complex problem. And at last, chapter 6 is dedicated to the KAS from the UK transplant. Those set of rules are the more recent and probably more complex. References "],
["data.html", "2 Upload data", " 2 Upload data KARS app uses as inputs three files with demographic and immunological information of kidney transplant candidates and deceased donors. This application can be used with the provided sample data, or by uploading user’s data. The available sample data is simulated data for a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates and for 70 potential deceased donors. "],
["example.html", "2.1 Example data", " 2.1 Example data The first sample dataset simulates a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates, with the columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2 ), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), candidate’s age in years (age), number of months on dialysis (dialysis) and calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies (cPRA) 2.1.

This candidate ID must match the ID of the transplant candidates’ waiting list to allow the determination of the virtual crossmatch between each candidate and the potential cadaver donor, as described in (3). Table 2.2: Variables for HLA-antibodies dataset variable description type options ID Identifier character abs HLA - antibodies character starts with: A, B or DR The last dataset compiles data from 70 potential deceased donors with the columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), donor’s age in years (age) 2.3.

The dataset of potential donors should also have a column with the Donor Risk Index (DRI) as described in 6. "],
["users.html", "2.2 User’s data", " 2.2 User’s data This application allow any user to upload their own data. For this purpose the user just have to select the option ‘Upload your files’ and browse the files 2.1. Figure 2.1: ‘Upload your files’ option The data uploaded by the user must have the same format as the examples described in 2.1. If the users’ data do not have the same format the app will return the message: Candidates column names are not identical to example data! Also, the user must be aware if he/she want to use the UK transplant algorithm. In this case the option ‘UK’ must be selected and the files must have the extra columns described in table 2.1 and table 2.3. In the KARS app the user can upload a .txt or .csv file specifying ‘File’s delimiter’ from the available options 2.2. Figure 2.2: ‘Files delimiter’ options Those files must have the same exact header (case sensitive) as the ones from the example data. For the bg field (both for candidates and donors) the valid options are A, AB, B and O. The HLA typing for the HLA-A, -B and –DRB1 loci must have a consistent resolution level for the HLA-antibodies identified in the second dataset, as well, with the HLA typing of potential deceased donors. For instance, if HLA typing for the candidates is in serological resolution so the donor’s typing and identified HLA antibodies must be in serological resolution. In like manner, for a genotyping resolution all HLA must be consistent. When the allele have a 0 on the left (meaning A01 or DR04) it can be omitted only if this always the case as we do in our example data. By the same token, on our example data, if donors have the values 1 and 4 for columns DR1 and DR2, so the correspondent HLA antibodies in the second dataset (2.3) will be DR1 and DR4, respectively. In order to avoid problems with blanks on HLA typing, candidates and / or donors must be considered homozigous and the alleles must be repeated (as an example: instead of B15,- consider B15,15) "],

["conclusion.html", "7 Conclusions", " 7 Conclusions An allocation system for deceased donor kidneys should be anchored to transparent policies. It should take into account the relationship between supply and demand, hence seeking a balance between the higher net benefit of survival that can be provided by a particular organ and the transplant candidates’ waiting time (as well as the probability of being transplanted) (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). The discussion about access to kidney transplantation with deceased donors never comes to a close and must be done clearly and systematically in order to enable the best decisions at any given moment (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for many ESRD patients; however, the small number of organs for transplantation does not allow all patients to have access to this scarce resource. So, it is of utmost importance to define objective and systematic metrics with clinical utility that allow making informed decisions when health policies are established for the distribution of an organ (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2014).
