["index.html", "KARS user manual Preface", " KARS user manual Bruno A Lima 2020-12-28 Preface The Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator (KARS) is an application that allows to simulate different kidney allocation rules in transplantation. This application is built on shiny and is available on shinyapps.io: https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/ Before implementing new rules, it is necessary to test them in order to dissipate, as much as possible, doubts questioning implementation’s success. The development of this application had as motivation being an aid to clarify the usefulness and efficiency of new set of rules for kidney allocation. KARS app is part of my PhD thesis on the PhD program in Health Data Science (HEADS). Disclaimer: KARS application is intended for research purposes only, not for clinical or commercial use.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

["data.html", "2 Upload data", " 2 Upload data KARS app uses as inputs three files with demographic and immunological information of kidney transplant candidates and deceased donors. This application can be used with the provided sample data, or by uploading user’s data. The available sample data is simulated data for a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates and for 70 potential deceased donors. "],
["example-data.html", "2.1 Example data", " 2.1 Example data The first sample dataset simulates a waiting list of 500 kidney transplant candidates, with the columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2 ), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), candidate’s age in years (age), number of months on dialysis (dialysis) and calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies (cPRA) 2.1.

This candidate ID must match the ID of the transplant candidates’ waiting list to allow the determination of the virtual crossmatch between each candidate and the potential cadaver donor, as described in (XXXXX). Table 2.2: Variables for HLA-antibodies dataset variable description type options ID Identifier character abs HLA - antibodies character starts with: A, B or DR The last dataset compiles data from 70 potential deceased donors with the columns: Identifier (ID), blood group (bg), HLA-A typing (A1, A2), HLA-B typing (B1, B2), HLA-DRB1 typing (DR1, DR2), donor’s age in years (age) 2.3.

The dataset of potential donors should also have a column with the Donor Risk Index (DRI). "],
["users-data.html", "2.2 User’s data", " 2.2 User’s data This application allow any user to upload their one data. For this purpose the user just have to select the option ‘Upload your files’ and browse the files 2.1. Figure 2.1: ‘Upload your files’ option The data uploaded by the user must have the same format as the examples described above.If the users’ data do not have the same format the app will return the message ‘Candidates column names are not identical to example data!’. Also, the user must be aware if he/she want to use the UK transplant algorithm, in this case the option ‘UK’ must be selected and the files must have the extra columns described in table 2.1 and table 2.3. In the KARS app the user can upload a .txt or .csv file specifying ‘File’s delimiter’ from the available options 2.2. Figure 2.2: ‘Files delimiter’ options Those files must have the same exact header (case sensitive) as the ones from the example data. For the bg field (both for candidates and donors) the valid options are A, AB, B and O. The HLA typing for the HLA-A, -B and –DRB1 loci must have a consistent resolution level for the HLA-antibodies identified in the second dataset, as well, with the HLA typing of potential deceased donors. For instance, if HLA typing for the candidates is in serological resolution so the donor’s typing and identified HLA antibodies must be in serological resolution. In like manner, for a genotyping resolution all HLA must be consistent. When the allele have a 0 on the left (meaning A01 or DR04) it can be omitted only if this always the case as we do in our example data. By the same token, on our example data, if donors have the values 1 and 4 for columns DR1 and DR2, so the correspondent HLA antibodies in the second dataset (2.3) will be DR1 and DR4, respectively. In order to avoid problems with blanks on HLA typing, candidates and / or donors must be considered homozigous and the alleles must be repeated (as an example: instead of B15,- consider B15,15) "],
