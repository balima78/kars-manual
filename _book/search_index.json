["index.html", "KARS user manual Preface", " KARS user manual Bruno A Lima 2020-12-27 Preface The Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator (KARS) is an application that allows to simulate different kidney allocation rules in transplantation. This application is built on shiny and is available on shinyapps.io: https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/ Before implementing new rules, it is necessary to test them in order to dissipate, as much as possible, doubts questioning implementation’s success. The development of this application had as motivation being an aid to clarify the usefulness and efficiency of new set of rules for kidney allocation. KARS app is part of my PhD thesis on the PhD program in Health Data Science (HEADS). Disclaimer: KARS application is intended for research purposes only, not for clinical or commercial use.

["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
