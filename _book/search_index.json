The demand for kidneys for transplantation grows daily due to the successful treatment of many patients with end stage renal disease. Although, the limited number of organs available for transplantation requires that their distribution must be made as equitable as possible in order to optimize the use of this scarce resource (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013a). For patients with end stage renal disease, kidney transplantation provides a lower mortality, reduction of cardiovascular problems and a better quality of life compared with those on dialysis, even for those with advanced age or co-morbidities (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). Criteria such as: clinical urgency, waiting time, diagnosis, duration of ischaemia, transplant outcomes, number of organs available for paediatric transplants, transplantation in the elderly, time on dialysis, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility and the presence or absence of HLA antibodies; should be taken into account when discussing access to kidney transplantation (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). This users manual describes how to use the Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator (KARS) app available from here: https://balima.shinyapps.io/kars/. The manual is divided in 7 chapters, the first one is this Introduction (1), the last one is a simple Conclusion (7) and the remaining 5 correspond to the 5 modules on KARS app, four of them are different Kidney Allocation Systems (KAS). The chapter 2 describes the type of data used in the application and how the user can upload their own data. This data is not stored anywhere on our app and the responsibility for its usage is entirely to the user. Chapter 3 presents the Portuguese algorithm on the allocation of kidneys from deceased donors and how the user can modify some parameters in order to understand how it works. In chapter 4 the KAS from EuroTransplnat is described and its merits discussed. Chapter 5 present a KAS published by us in 2013 (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b) and was intented to give a simple (maybe too simple) solution for a complex problem. And at last, chapter 6 is dedicated to the KAS from the UK transplant. Those set of rules are the more recent and probably more complex. The principal aim of this app is to compare different KAS on transplantation. We do not describe an alternative way to design a proposal for a new KAS. In fact, we did not question, possible ways to define models for a new KAS. If a new set of rules on donor-recipient pair selection in kidney transplantation is needed, to achieve this goal distinct sources can be used: evaluation of different data models, a systematic literature review; an idea based on empirical knowledge; or a consensus established at a brainstorm with a selected group of experts (Lima and Alves 2019). Although, any proposal for a new KAS has to be submitted to a set of simulations in order to predict its outcomes as far as possible. Only publishing a new proposal in a peer reviewed paper will allow public scrutiny of its merits and its assessment with data from different sources.

The dataset of potential donors should also have a column with Donor Risk Index (DRI) as described in section 6.1.3. "],["users.html", "2.2 Users data", " 2.2 Users data This application allow any user to upload their own data. For this purpose users just have to select option Upload your files and browse the files: Figure 2.1: Upload your files option The data uploaded by the user must have the same format as examples described in section 2.1. If users data do not have the same format, KARS app will return the message: Candidates column names are not identical to example data! Also, users must be aware if he/she want to use UK transplant algorithm. In this case option UK must be selected and files must have extra columns described in table 2.1 and table 2.3. In KARS app, users can upload a .txt or .csv file specifying Files delimiter from available options: Figure 2.2: Files delimiter options Those files must have the same exact header (case sensitive) as the ones from example data. For bg field (both for candidates and donors) the valid options are: A, AB, B and O. The HLA typing for HLA-A, -B and DRB1 loci must have a consistent resolution level for HLA-antibodies identified in the second dataset, as well, with HLA typing of potential deceased donors. For instance, if HLA typing for candidates is in serological resolution so donors typing and identified HLA antibodies must be in serological resolution too. In like manner, for a genotyping resolution all HLA must be consistent. When alleles have a 0 on the left (meaning A01 or DR04) it can be omitted only if this is always the case, as we do in our example data. By the same token, on our example data, if donors have the values 1 and 4 for columns DR1 and DR2, so the correspondent HLA antibodies in the second dataset (table 2.3) will be DR1 and DR4, respectively. In order to avoid problems with blanks on HLA typing, candidates and / or donors must be considered homozigous and the alleles must be repeated (as an example: instead of B15,- consider B15,15) For candidates dataset we recommend a sample size no longer than 2000 and for donors dataset a ratio of 1 / 7 candidates. Meaning, for 700 candidates use at most 100 donors. This ratio is suggested as guarantee that selected candidates for each KAS are comparable and we can spot differences due to KAS rules. As each donor is allocated to two candidates, with a number of donors close to half the number of candidates, we would have almost all candidates selected for all KAS simulations. Also, synthetic data for KARS app can be generated from the R package {simK}. This package was developed mainly for allowing data generation to use on KARS simulations.

The aim of that proposal was to define a simple and transparent set of rules that could be used as a baseline in comparison to others KAS. Also, with this color classification it would be easier to explain to patients, in a more intuitive manner, how far they are from being transplanted. This system of colors also takes into account the criteria of utility and justice for kidney distribution. By setting only 4 colour groups (figure 5.1) on the basis of justice (time on dialysis and probability of transplantation) and, within each of these groups, candidates are ordered based by efficiency (HLA compatibilities); the proposed criteria meant to be balanced (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). Whenever the risk of a poor transplant outcome exists and is predictable, this fact must be explained to the patient.

With an orange color are marked those patients with a cPRA &gt; 85% or with a time on dialysis higher than waiting time list 3rd quartile.

The UK transplant module on KARS app simulates the allocation of kidneys to a candidates waiting list for kidney-only transplants and do not take in consideration geographical criteria. The algorithm applied in KARS app is a simplification of the UK National Health Sistem policy. For each available donor, eligible candidates are those with a negative virtual crossmatch and ABO compatible with the donor. These candidates are them grouped in two TIERS: Figure 6.1: Ranked Tiers Within TIER A transplant candidates are ordered by matchability and time on dialysis. Transplant candidates within TIER B are prioritized according to a points-based system computed with 7 elements. Donor - recipient blood group compatibility is defined as ABO identical, with exceptions: B candidates can opt to O donors; AB candidates can opt to A donors; within TIER A, candidates A and AB can opt to O donors.

Those points are computed as the sum of 7 elements: Matchability Time on dialysis Donor-recipient risk index combinations HLA match and age combined Donor-recipient age difference Total HLA mismatch Blood group match 6.1.1 Matchability Points for matchability are calculated from the formula: \\(10 \\cdot (1 + (MatchScore / 4.5)^{4.7})\\), where \\(MatchScore\\) (MS) take values \\(1\\) trough \\(10\\) corresponding to candidates percentil on waiting list when computed the number of donors ABO identical and HLA compatible for each candidate. In the example data provided on KARS app, \\(MS\\) were assigned randomly with a probability of 0.03 for \\(MS = 10\\). 6.1.2 Time on dialysis For each day on dialysis, 1 point is given to transplant candidates, meaning that for each month on dialysis, 30 points are assigned to candidates. As described for example data, time on dialysis must be in months. Time on dialysis (column dialysis) must be in months! In order to maintain congruence between the criteria used in the different app allocation systems, uploaded time on dialysis must be in months. 6.1.3 Donor-recipient risk index combinations As described in the example data, candidates dataset have a column for recipient risk index (RRI) and donors dataset have a column for donor risk index (DRI). Also, users data must have these columns. Both RRI and DRI can have 4 categories, R1 to R4 and D1 to D4, respectively. Computation of recipients and donors categories are described on UK National Health Sistem policy. Points are defined as: Table 6.1: Donor-Recipient risk index combinations.

"],["conclusion.html", "7 Conclusions", " 7 Conclusions An allocation system for deceased donor kidneys should be anchored to transparent policies. It should take into account the relationship between supply and demand, hence seeking a balance between the higher net benefit of survival that can be provided by a particular organ and the transplant candidates waiting time (as well as the probability of being transplanted) (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). The discussion about access to kidney transplantation with deceased donors never comes to a close and must be done clearly and systematically in order to enable the best decisions at any given moment (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2013b). Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for many ESRD patients; however, the small number of organs for transplantation does not allow all patients to have access to this scarce resource. So, it is of utmost importance to define objective and systematic metrics with clinical utility that allow making informed decisions when health policies are established for the distribution of an organ (Lima, Mendes, and Alves 2014). For defining and implementing a new KAS, we do not need to reinvent the wheel. At this point, we should be able to process data, compare it with other experiences, looking abroad for allocation systems that work and can help us to improve and fulfill our purposes (Lima and Alves 2018).
